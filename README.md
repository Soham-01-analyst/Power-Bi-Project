# Power-Bi-Project
HR Analytics Dashboard project built in Power BI. 
ðŸš€ Excited to showcase my latest HR Analytics Dashboard project built in Power BI! ðŸš€

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, understanding employee attrition and workforce trends has become more important than ever. So, I took the initiative to explore an HR dataset, diving deep into the factors behind employee turnover, and translating the data into actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
 The goal of this project was to identify the key drivers of employee attrition and help HR teams make data-informed decisions to improve retention strategies and boost employee satisfaction.

ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used:
 âœ… Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation
 âœ… DAX for calculated measures and KPIs
 âœ… Data cleaning & transformation
 âœ… HR analytics & storytelling through data

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights From the Dashboard:
 ðŸ“Š Attrition by Age Group: Employees aged 26-35 represent the highest attrition rate, suggesting a focus on career development and growth opportunities is critical for this demographic.
 ðŸ“Š Attrition by Gender: Male employees show a higher exit rate compared to females, signaling the need to investigate factors like job roles and work-life balance.
 ðŸ“Š Attrition by Department: The Sales and Research & Development departments have the highest turnover, indicating these areas may benefit from tailored retention initiatives.
 ðŸ“Š Attrition by Business Travel: Frequent travelers are more prone to leave, possibly due to burnout or lack of work-life balance.
 ðŸ“Š Attrition by Job Role & Marital Status: Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians experience higher attrition, and unmarried employees tend to leave more often than their married counterparts.

âœ¨ What I Learned:
 Working on this project not only enhanced my Power BI skills but also deepened my understanding of HR metrics and how to use data to tell a compelling story. It was a rewarding experience translating raw data into actionable insights that can directly impact an organizationâ€™s workforce strategy.
